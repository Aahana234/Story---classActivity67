Once upon a time, there was a lion in the jungle .He was sleeping .
Then one mouse came started playing woth him while he was sleeping .
He started jumping up and down on him. This activity awakened the lion and opened his big jaws to swallow him.
The mouse started asking forgiveness and he said forgibe me this time .I shall never repeat it again and I shall never forget about your kindness.
